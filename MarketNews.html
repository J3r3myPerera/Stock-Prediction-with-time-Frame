      the best stocks to buy and watch, be sure to pay attention to relative price strength.IBD's proprietary rating 
      identifies price performance with a 1 (worst) to 99 (best) score. The score shows how a stock's price performance 
      over the last 52 weeks compares to all the other stocks in our database.History reveals that the stocks that go on

      working on a consolidation with a 490.93 buy point. Along with the new RS number, the stock is showing high EPS 
      and Composite rating numbers, both in the 90+ range. Let's see if it can clear the breakout price in heavy trading.

    <h2>Oracle Stock On 3-Day Upswing, Shows Rising Composite Rating</h2>
    <p>On Monday, Oracle (ORCL) got an upgrade for its IBD SmartSelect Composite Rating from 93 to 97.<br>The upgrade means 
      the stock is now outperforming 97% of all other stocks in terms of key performance metrics and technical strength. 
      Winning stocks often have a 95 or higher score in the early stages of a new price run, so that's an important 
      benchmark to look for when looking for the best stocks to buy and watch.Oracle is not currently near a proper buy 
      zone. It was working on a cup with handle base, but failed to clear the buy point, so that base has expired. Now we 
      look for the stock to form and break out of a new base as the RS rating hits 90 and the RS Line gets close to a new 
      high.

    <h2>Is SQ Stock A Buy Or Sell Amid Hindenburg Research Short Position?</h2>
    <p>When you think of SQ stock, cryptocurrency Bitcoin quickly comes to mind. There's also a big acquisition to mull for Square 
      stock as well as a corporate rebranding.Amid rising fears of a U.S. recession, one question is how resistant Square-parent 
      Block (SQ) will be to a business downturn versus other digital payment companies. If the Federal Reserve successfully 
      engineers a "soft landing" for the U.S. economy, that would be a plus for Block stock.Shares in Block plunged March 23 after 
      Hindenburg Research disclosed a short position in SQ stock while claiming that the digital payment company inflates Cash App 
      user metrics and facilitates fraud.Square fought back against the charges. The company said it may pursue legal action against 
      Hindenburg.Many analysts backed up Block." The biggest accusation from the short-seller, from our interpretation, is that SQ 
      is effectively a fraudulent business both in operations/reporting while allowing nefarious activities on its platform," 
      Oppenheimer analyst Dominick Gabriele said in a note to clients. "We believe the probability these accusations are correct is 
      extremely low."At UBS, analyst Rayna Kumar said in a report: "One widely discussed claim from the report is that Block 
      conceals the number of users on the Cash App platform by disclosing transacting active metrics based on fake and duplicate 
      accounts, suggesting the reported user metrics are inflated. While we cannot verify whether or not that claim is true, we note 
      that Cash App users is only one metric provided by Block to assess the performance of the Cash App business. He added: "Unlike 
      most other companies, every quarter, Block releases a shareholder letter that walks shareholders and analysts through a number 
      of performance metrics tied to its businesses and allows for multiple ways to gauge the health of its segments."Hammered by 
      the Hindenburg report, Square stock was down 1.5% in 2023 as of March 24. Block traded near 90, on Feb. 2. Shares plunged 
      about 61% last year.In its core businesses, Square stock aims to build a two-sided digital payments ecosystem, with products 
      designed for both merchant sellers and consumer buyers. The Square Cash App helps individuals manage money, buy stocks and 
      cryptocurrency, and more.

    <h2>Stocks Fall as Bank Woes Spread</h2>
    <p>A selloff in Deutsche Bank and other European banking shares weighed on global markets Friday, suggesting that strains in 
      the financial system have yet to be resolved.Upheaval that began with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and some other 
      midsize U.S. lenders spread to Europe with Credit Suisse’s forced sale to UBS last weekend.Though major European banks lack 
      some of the vulnerabilities of regional U.S. lenders, investors are nervous about issues such as funding costs, following 
      the unexpected wipeout of riskier Credit Suisse bonds.Michael Bell, global market strategist at J. P. Morgan Asset Management, 
      said investors were trying to determine to “what extent do concerns around the banking system bleed to even further 
      credit-condition tightening.”That would determine the outlook for stock markets, Mr. Bell said. He said the risk of a recession 
      had risen in both Europe and the U.S., and that a downturn has historically weighed on stocks. Still, he added that central 
      banks and other authorities are likely to respond forcefully to any further stress in the banking industry.In recent market 
      action, U.S. stocks fell. The S&P 500 dropped 0.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.5%, and the Nasdaq Composite edged 
      down 0.3%. Losses were more pronounced in Europe. Shares of Deutsche Bank fell 11%, leading a broad decline for the region’s 
      banking sector. Commerzbank fell more than 7%, Société Générale more than 6%, and UBS over 5%.Government bond prices rose. 
      That pushed the yield on 10-year Treasurys down to 3.301%, on course for the lowest settle since September, from 3.406% 
      Thursday. Two-year yields fell to 3.595% from 3.808%.Traders doubled down on bets that the Federal Reserve will keep interest 
      rates on hold at its May meeting. The probability implied by interest-rate futures stood at 99%, compared with 73% Thursday, 
      according to CME Group.The dollar strengthened, in another sign investors were seeking haven assets. The WSJ Dollar Index 
      gained 0.5%.Oil prices retreated. Most-active futures for Brent crude fell 2.7% to $73.42 a barrel.
